Structure:
Design - Move to a truly plug-and-play game with microcontrollers built-in to each module.
Controllers communicate with SPI.
SPI: 3 core lines (clock, MISO, MOSI) + 1 line per slave (slave select)
Common connection will require 6 pins: +5V, GND, CLK, MISO, MOSI, SSx

Master (placed in the timer)
Will:
- be the game controller,
- poll the slaves to identify which modules are connected on startup,
- continually poll slaves to pick up module info and vice versa,
- control the timer and strike lights, buzzer, edge work (serial, indicators)
Needs:
- to take game customisation options - IR receiver or bluetooth to phone app
- enough pins to have 11 Slave selects, core SPI, run timer, run strikes, run buzzer

Slave (placed in all other modules)
Will:
- run module logic and interface with the buttons/wires/displays,
- update strike/success to the master,
Need:
- enough pins to control module-specific components, and SPI


Modules:


Physical construction:
Modules made from flat inner-front plate, outer-front plate and box.
Inner-front plate is flat on the outside with extrusions back to receive screws.
Outer-front plate is flat on the bottom with the module-specific design printed into it. This is glued onto the inner-front plate.
Box consists of the back and sides, with screw holes. This allows the box and front plates to be screwed together. There will be a connector on the back side, so when the module is slid into the case it will be hooked up to the comm and power bus.
